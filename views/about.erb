  <h1>What is threeTasks?</h1>

  <p>threeTasks is a simple to-do list. The basic idea is to define the 3 things you want to do today.
    Then, as you go through your day, you do them and mark them off.</p>
  <br>

  <h1>Can I have more than 3?</h1>

  <p>No, three shall be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be three.
    Four shalt thou not count, neither count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three. Five is right
    out. </p>

  <p>Seriously, the site is called threeTasks. By putting more on the list, one of two things will happen:
  <ul class='about'>
    <li>You'll put a lot of trivial tasks on the list, and spend time on those instead of what's really important</li>
    <li>You'll have too much to get done in one day, and then you'll feel like a failure because your list keeps
      growing
    </li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <h1>Are you going to spam me?</h1>

  <p>Absolutely not!</p>
